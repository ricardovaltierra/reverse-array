# reverse-array

## Task:
Without using standard library functions, write the reverse function that takes an array and returns an array in reverse order.

### How it works:
- Clone the repo (must have ruby installed locally)
- Run the file (e.g. `ruby reverse-array.rb`)
- Type one integer as the lenght of the array
  * The array is randomly created, then sorted
